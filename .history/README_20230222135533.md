- Parcel
- Rollup

What problem is this tool trying to solve?
Vite:
Vite seeks to overcome the problem of sluggish build times during web development by offering a quick and lightweight work place.

Parcel:
Without the need for any further settings, Parcel is used to locate and package all necessary files into one. This makes the process of building a web application easier.

Rollup:
Rollup is a module bundler that is used to minimize the size and performance of web applications. This is performed by analyzing the code and include just the modules that are necessary in the final output bundle.

 How does it solve the problem? AKA, what makes this tool unique?
Vite:
By utilizing a development server with an in-memory file system and hot module replacement, Vite is able to quickly construct applications and make changes to the browser without having to completely reload the page.

Parcel:
Parcel is a zero-configuration build tool that simplifies code bundling and transcoding. This software accepts a variety of file kinds and selects the suitable configuration depending on the input files.

Rollup:
Rollup simplifies the process of packaging JavaScript libraries and apps for production. It also aids in the removal of unnecessary code, resulting in smaller, more efficient bundles.

When shouldn't you use this tool?
Vite:
Vite is not the best tool for larger or more complex jobs. Because its major focus is on development speed and efficiency, projects that need considerable setup, code splitting, or static site construction wouldn’t be a good fit for this tool.

Parcel:
For large-scale business applications or projects with intricate build needs, it might not be the appropriate choice. Parcel cannot provide all the customization and optimization requirements of more complicated projects since it automatically decides the settings depending on the input files.

Rollup:
Rollup is not the right tool for simple or straightforward projects. This is because there’s not enough development servers or hot module replacement support as other build tools, and this tool’s primary focus is on bundling and optimization.

Name two features you find interesting/useful and explain why they are helpful.
Two features out of all the tools that I found interesting would be:
 Vites module replacement: With the help of this tool, developers are able to modify a module or component in the application while it is still in deployed without having to restart the server or refresh the page. This is helpful because it could speed up development process and boost productivity.
 and
Rollups tree-shaking: It helps eliminate unneeded code from your program, lowering code bundle size and increasing speed. This is especially beneficial for bigger programs or libraries with several dependencies.


What other information should someone know before using this tool?
Before using these tools, it is important to understand their settings, plugin ecosystem, compatibility, performance, and support as each one is different and may or may not be able to match the demands of your project.

After you have answered the above questions about each tool, compare and contrast the three tools. What makes each one unique? What makes them different? When would you use one over the other, and why?
All of them are there to help make developing a site easier but each one has their own way of helping developers as previously mentioned. Put it this way,  Parcel is made to be simple to use and adaptable, Vite is meant for quick development, and Rollup is focused on creating effective and optimal bundles for production.


From the three tools, you choose to compare and contrast, choose one, and create a sample repo to show off the tool's features.
In your sample repo, develop a very basic example app to show off the features of the tool. Do not use any of the examples in the tools documentation.
